# Newton-Raphson-Based-Optimizer-NRBO-
The Newton-Raphson-Based Optimizer, a new metaheuristic algorithm, is suggested and developed in this paper. The NRBO is inspired by Newton-Raphson's approach, and it explores the entire search process using two rules: the Newton-Raphson Search Rule (NRSR) and the TAO and a few groups of matrices to explore the best results further.
